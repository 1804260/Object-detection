# Object-detection
This algorithm identifies 80 different types of objects and classifies them in cateogary.

We load the algorythm. Then run the algorythm we need three files:
1. Weight file: it’s the trained model, the core of the algorythm to detect the objects.
2. Cfg file: it’s the configuration file, where there are all the settings of the algorythm.
3. Name files: contains the name of the objects that the algorythm can detect.

Yolo weights file link is provide there to download the file click the link you will be directed to the google drive.
Keep all the files in the same folder and use any python code complier to run the code.
Image file is also provided use same image for the code if image is changed then change the root directory and name of the image in the code.
