# Object-detection
This algorithm identifies 80 different types of objects and classifies them in catogary.
We load the algorythm. Then run the algorythm we need three files:
1. Weight file: it’s the trained model, the core of the algorythm to detect the objects.
2. Cfg file: it’s the configuration file, where there are all the settings of the algorythm.
3. Name files: contains the name of the objects that the algorythm can detect.
